			<h1>Welcome to The Impossible Media Studios</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>This is The Impossible Media Studios' first game - </p>
			<h2>Trading Game</h2>
			<p>This game involves the player buying and selling goods to earn money to open a shop. The twist? Well, prices can fluctuate. Inline with real world trading, prices are not stable and things like supply and demand will affect the buy and sell prices of goods. It's up to the player to make inform decisions based on the market news. <br> Good Luck!</p>
